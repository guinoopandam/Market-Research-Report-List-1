<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Roof Drainage System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gravity Drainage System</li><li>Siphonic Drainage System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The roof drainage system market is primarily categorized into two types: Gravity Drainage Systems and Siphonic Drainage Systems. Gravity Drainage Systems rely on gravitational force to direct water to drains, utilizing a sloped roof design. In contrast, Siphonic Drainage Systems utilize negative pressure to efficiently transport water through horizontal piping, allowing for fewer downspouts and reduced roof drain sizes. Both systems cater to different architectural needs, enhancing water management and preventing roof-related issues.</p></p>
