<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Wrap Film Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cast Film</li><li>Calendered Film</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive wrap film market is primarily divided into cast film and calendered film types. Cast film is produced by pouring molten polymer onto a flat surface, resulting in a thinner, more flexible wrap that conforms easily to complex vehicle shapes and offers exceptional durability.
